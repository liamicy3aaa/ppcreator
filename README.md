# PPCreator

PPCreator is a small project which i built back in May 2020 to speed up the creation of presentations for online quiz nights for a local client. This was built in 1 day and really helped us run 10 successful online quiz sessions through the course of the first UK lockdown in 2020. 

This was a really fun project to do as it involved learning about a PHP framework which is designed to help create PowerPoint presentations. Starting with a presentation design we already had for the first session, it mainly involved translating that design into code format. 

### Built with
* PHP
* Jquery
* Bootstrap
* phpoffice
* pclzip
